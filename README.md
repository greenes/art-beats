# art-beats

My sister, an artist, graduated from VCU, a top art school, with a painting degree. She has struggled to find a way to get her art in front of people. She wants to be able to showcase all of her pieces easily and also to connect with other artists in her area to collaborate on in-person events where potential buyers may be.

This application will allow artists to showcase their art in a forum that facilitates connections between other artists and postential customers, netowrking opportunities, and event collaboration. 

Potential buyers, curators, and anyone interested can browse artwork by searching in their area, by artist, or by medium.
